# A-B-Testing

This repository contains Python code implementing two popular algorithms: Epsilon-Greedy and Thompson Sampling. It also includes visualization and reporting functions to analyze the performance of these algorithms.

## Overview

- `bandit.py`: Contains the definition of the `Bandit` abstract class and its subclasses `EpsilonGreedy` and `ThompsonSampling`, which implement the two MAB algorithms.
- `visualization.py`: Provides visualization functions for plotting the learning process and cumulative rewards of the bandit algorithms.
- `main.py`: Demonstrates how to use the bandit algorithms, visualize their performance, and generate reports.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
